When the calls come in, day or night, they're always ready for the worst, and always ready to do their best. <b>Hellfire Heroes</b> follows two firefighting crews, led by Chief Jamie Coutts of Lesser Slave Lake and Chief Albert Bahri of Yellowhead County. Slave Lake firefighters include 19-year-old rookie Logan Skahl, Lt. Patrick McConnell, an expert in vehicle extrication, rope and confined space rescue, and Ryan Coutts, the Chief's son. The Yellowhead County crew features straight-talking Gabby Sundstrom, hard-charging Captain Corinne Grant, and ‘speed-demon' Mike Toniak. No matter what comes their way, from battling a raging home fire, to Search and Rescue, saving lives on the most remote highways, or delivering a new life, no job is too big, or too small.
